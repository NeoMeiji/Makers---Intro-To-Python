# When looking at strings, I mentioned the concept of data
# structures.

# To remind you, a data structure is a collection of data
# organised in a certain way. A string is a sequence of
# characters.

# We're now going to look at another kind â€” the list. A list
# is a sequence of items, and those items can be of any
# type.

# Here's are two examples:

my_favourite_numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
my_friends = ["Victoria", "Mel", "Melanie", "Emma"]

# Notice how the square brackets `[` and `]` tell Python
# that this is a list, and how the commas separate the items
# in the list.

# It's common to forget these commas so add it to your list
# of things to check when your code doesn't work.

# @TASK Try making your own here:

# My own example below:

my_list = ["Agadir", "Stresa", "St. Tropez", "Gujaranwala", "Hanza Valley"]
print(my_list)
print("---")

my_favourite_manga_artists = ["Takehiko Inoue", "Hirohiko Araki", "Yoshitaka Amano","Takeshi Obata"]
print(my_favourite_manga_artists)
print("---")

# Can have a list (a sequence of items) with different data types e.g., 

this_is_an_example_of_a_list_with_different_data_types = [24, "Kobe Bryant", 7, "Christiano Ronaldo", 1, 6, "Are lucky numbers to roll on a dice"]
print(this_is_an_example_of_a_list_with_different_data_types)

# @TASK and print it out by running:

#   python 029_lists.py

# When you're done, move on to 030_list_indexing.py
